## Executive Summary  
The Cambodia–Thailand border conflict intensified overnight as Cambodian forces seized a key outpost near the contested Preah Vihear Temple, triggering heavy artillery exchanges and prompting Thailand to mobilize reserve units. ASEAN foreign ministers have called an emergency session in Jakarta, while China and the United States jockey for influence—China offering shuttle diplomacy, the U.S. pledging intelligence support to Bangkok. Markets are jittery: the Thai baht slipped to a six-month low, and regional rice and rubber futures spiked on supply concerns. Thousands of civilians have fled into makeshift camps on both sides of the border, testing the capacity of UN agencies and local NGOs. As the crisis deepens, ASEAN unity and regional stability hang in the balance.

## 🚨 Today's Lead Story  
### Cambodia Captures Strategic Preah Vihear Outpost, Escalating Border War  
In a pre-dawn operation on January 25, Cambodian infantry and armored units overran the Thai-held Khao Phra Wihan ridge, a vantage point 15 kilometers inside Thailand’s Si Sa Ket province. Phnom Penh says the move reclaims territory lost during last year’s skirmishes around the 11th-century temple. Bangkok denounces the assault as a “blatant violation” of Thai sovereignty, reporting at least 12 soldiers killed and 34 wounded. Cambodian officials claim minimal casualties, though independent verification is pending.  
The capture of the ridge gives Cambodia line-of-sight to key Thai troop concentrations and supply routes, raising fears of a broader ground offensive. ASEAN secretary-general Kao Kim Hourn has urged both sides to cease hostilities, while calls grow for an immediate ceasefire.

## 🎯 Editor's Analysis  
**Key Themes Today:**  
- Escalation of conventional conflict in a historically unsettled border region  
- Intensifying great-power competition via military aid and diplomacy  

**What This Means:**  
The swift militarization and involvement of China and the U.S. risk turning a bilateral border clash into a proxy arena. ASEAN’s credibility as a neutral mediator is on the line, as fragmentation among member states could encourage further regional disputes. Markets and supply chains face ongoing disruption, with ripple effects across Southeast Asia’s agrarian economies.  

**Looking Ahead:**  
- ASEAN emergency summit outcomes—will ministers agree on a ceasefire mechanism?  
- Potential U.N. Security Council discussions if hostilities continue  
- Humanitarian corridors: testing ASEAN’s capacity for coordinated relief
