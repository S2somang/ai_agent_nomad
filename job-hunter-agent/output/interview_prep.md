# Interview Prep: Xebia – Senior Golang Developer

## Job Overview
Senior Golang Developer  
Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands (Hybrid, up to 2 days remote/week)  
Type: Full-time | Salary: €60,000–€75,000/year  
Xebia seeks a hands-on engineer to design, build and maintain high-performance microservices in Go.

## Predicted Interview Questions
1. **Golang Fundamentals**  
   - Explain how goroutines and channels work. Give an example of a worker-pool pattern.  
   - How does Go’s garbage collector impact microservices?  
   - How do you use the `context` package to handle cancellations/timeouts?

2. **Microservices Design**  
   - Describe your approach to API versioning in gRPC vs REST.  
   - How do you ensure data consistency across distributed services (Sagas, idempotency)?  
   - What patterns have you used for service discovery and fault tolerance?

3. **Containerization & Kubernetes**  
   - Walk us through a Docker multi-stage build you’ve authored.  
   - How do you manage Kubernetes Deployments, StatefulSets and rollout strategies?  
   - When would you choose Helm over Kustomize?

4. **CI/CD & Observability**  
   - How have you implemented CI/CD pipelines? Which tools and stages?  
   - How do you set up Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards?  
   - Describe an Infrastructure-as-Code setup you contributed to (Terraform/CloudFormation).

5. **Leadership & Collaboration**  
   - How do you conduct effective code reviews and give constructive feedback?  
   - Tell us about mentoring a junior engineer—what challenges did you face?  
   - How do you work with product owners and architects to clarify requirements?

## Questions to Ask Them
1. “How is the Go Chapter structured at Xebia, and how often do you hold cross-chapter knowledge-sharing sessions?”  
2. “What are the biggest technical challenges the team faces with its current microservices landscape?”  
3. “Can you describe your standard approach to API gateway patterns and service discovery in production?”  
4. “What opportunities exist for senior developers to contribute to Xebia’s open-source initiatives or internal tooling?”  
5. “How do you measure service reliability (SLOs, error budgets) and what improvements are planned in the next 6–12 months?”

## Concepts To Know/Review
- Go concurrency: goroutines, channels, select statements  
- Go memory model and garbage collection  
- gRPC vs REST: streaming, deadlines, error handling  
- Docker best practices: multi-stage builds, image slimming  
- Kubernetes core objects: Pods, Deployments, Services, StatefulSets  
- Helm charts and Kustomize basics  
- CI/CD pipeline design (GitLab CI / Jenkins / GitHub Actions)  
- Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana visualization  
- Infrastructure-as-Code fundamentals (Terraform workflows)  
- Unit/integration testing in Go (`testing` package, mocks)

## Strategic Advice
Tone & Presence  
- Be **confident** yet **curious**. Show genuine enthusiasm for Go and microservices at enterprise scale.  
- Practice **concise storytelling**: quantify impact (e.g., “reduced API latency by 30%”).

Focus Areas  
- Emphasize your **Docker/Kubernetes** know-how as a bridge to Xebia’s cloud-native environment.  
- Highlight quick learning: your path from Node.js/Python to Go—show code samples or a brief demo if asked.  
- Underscore your **mentorship** experiences and desire to grow others.

Red Flags & Pitfalls  
- Avoid over-emphasizing non-Go work—pivot every technical example to concepts transferrable to Golang.  
- Don’t speculate on salary or remote policy too early; wait for the appropriate stage.  
- Be ready to address the difference in years of Go experience: focus on depth, not just duration.

Good luck! Prepare specific anecdotes, brush up on real-world Go code, and convey how you’ll drive Xebia’s microservices to the next level.
