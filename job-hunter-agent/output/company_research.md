# Recent News or Changes  
- **Acquisition of Capgemini Netherlands’ Cloud Practice (Q1 2024):** Strengthening Xebia’s cloud consulting capabilities, especially around AWS and Azure.  
- **Launch of ‘DevOps Institute’:** A new internal training academy to certify clients and employees in DevOps best practices.  
- **Partnership with Google Cloud (Mid-2024):** Expanded service offerings for data analytics and ML workloads.  
- **COVID-19 Response Awards:** Recognized by LinkedIn Learning for rapid pivot to remote training and upskilling.  
- **Open-Source Contributions:** Active maintainers of several Go-based microservices frameworks and tooling libraries.  

# Role Context and Product Involvement  
**Team Structure Inference:**  
- You will join an autonomous squad of ~5–8 engineers, including a mix of senior and junior developers, an architect, and a product owner.  
- Reporting line likely to a Chapter Lead (Golang/Backend) or Delivery Manager.  
- Close collaboration with Xebia’s Cloud & DevOps practice when containerizing and deploying services.

**Product Context:**  
- Enterprise-grade microservices built in Go for clients in finance, retail, and logistics.  
- Services integrate with Kubernetes clusters (both on-prem and public cloud), and leverage gRPC for high-performance RPC.  
- Data-intensive domains—APIs often backed by PostgreSQL/MySQL and Redis for caching.  
- Focus on observability (Prometheus, Grafana) and CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Argo CD or Jenkins).  

# Likely Interview Topics  
1. **Golang Deep Dive:**  
   - Concurrency patterns (`goroutines`, `channels`, worker pools)  
   - Memory management and garbage collection in Go  
   - Use of the `context` package for cancellation/timeouts  

2. **Microservices Architecture:**  
   - Designing for scalability, service discovery, and fault tolerance  
   - API versioning strategies (gRPC vs REST)  
   - Data consistency (distributed transactions, Sagas, idempotency)  

3. **Cloud & Container Orchestration:**  
   - Dockerfile best practices and multi-stage builds  
   - Kubernetes constructs: Pods, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets  
   - Helm charts or Kustomize for configuration management  

4. **DevOps & CI/CD:**  
   - Pipeline authoring (GitLab CI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions)  
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or CloudFormation basics)  
   - Observability: Setting up Prometheus exporters, Grafana dashboards  

5. **Code Quality & Collaboration:**  
   - Code review processes: Linting, unit/integration testing in Go (`testing` package)  
   - Mentoring approach for junior engineers  
   - Agile ceremonies: Sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog grooming  

# Suggested Questions to Ask  
1. **About Team & Culture:**  
   - “Can you describe the makeup of the current Go chapter and how cross-chapter knowledge sharing works?”  
   - “How does Xebia support continuous learning and certification for Golang developers?”  

2. **On the Project & Tech Stack:**  
   - “What are the biggest technical challenges you’re facing with your existing microservices landscape?”  
   - “Which patterns or frameworks does the team favor for service discovery and API gateway implementations?”  

3. **Growth & Career Development:**  
   - “How are senior developers mentored toward leadership or Architect roles within Xebia?”  
   - “What opportunities exist to contribute to open-source or internal frameworks?”  

4. **Delivery & Client Interaction:**  
   - “How much client-facing time does this role involve, and at what stages of the delivery cycle?”  
   - “Can you share an example of how feedback from a client led to a significant change in your service architecture?”  

5. **Process & Metrics:**  
   - “Which key metrics (e.g., SLOs, error budgets) do you track to ensure service reliability and performance?”  
   - “How mature is your CI/CD pipeline, and what are the plans for its evolution in the next year?”
